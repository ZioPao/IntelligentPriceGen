BASE_PROMPT = """Consider this JSON: {new_prices}\n\n

I'm creating an economy system in a game.
I'll give you the following data in json form:
- Item Name
- Item FullType (You can understand better what it is)
- Item Weight
- Item Categories (Could be empty)
- Item BulletDefense Stat (Could be empty)
- Item Damage Stat (Could be empty)

Keep in mind:
- Weapons must be valued pretty high (AT LEAST $2500), but generally (especially for guns) you can go much higher. Account for other attributes, such as its weight and damage.\n
- Single bullets should cost a FRACTION of a clip or ammo boxex, like $1 or $2 per single bullet. These items must be set with the tag AMMO.
- Military items and military clothing items must be valued pretty high (AT LEAST $2000). Use their attributes, such as bullet defense, to guess an estimate.\n
- Items listed with Category "Blunt" are weapons.\n
- Some items can have the "BulletDefense" attribute. If it's higher than 0, the cost of the item should increase dramatically.\n
- Some items can have the "Damage" attribute. It can go from 0 to 10. The higher it is, the higher the price of the item.\n
- Items related to vehicles, like Trunks, shouldn't be valued too high and can be considered JUNK
- Items with category Accessory can be valued pretty high, but no more than $2000.\n
- Items with category Skill Book should be valued higher than $100. For example, Vol.1 should be $500, then Vol.2 should be $1000, then Vol.3 should be $1500, and so on. This doesn't apply for magazines.\n
- Items with the same name but different FullType must be set with the same price but listed as separate.\n
- Items that start with BBB in their fulltype should be valued WAY higher than other items.\n
- Items that start with Mov_ in their fullType are furniture, and should cost a lot\n
- Random stuff shouldn't be valued too high, such as Vehicle Parts, Food utensils, Make Up, random tools, etc. You can go as low as $5\n
- Price can NEVER be 0. You can use at most 2 decimals though.\n\n

Choose between the following TAGS depending on the item name and category:
- WEAPON
- AMMO
- CLOTHING
- MILITARY_CLOTHING
- FOOD
- FIRST_AID
- VARIOUS
- SKILL_BOOK
- FURNITURE

Use ONLY the tags that have been specified here.

This is the JSON of the previously generated prices, use them to keep new prices/tags consistent: \n\n{old_prices}\n\n
You MUST answer using the following json schema:
